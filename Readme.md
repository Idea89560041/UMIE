UMIE Dataset:

There are over 11.1K paired and 7.9K unpaired instances in the UMIE dataset, which contains a large collection of paired and unpaired underwater images of poor and good perceptual quality, which types include distortion-free, chromatic aberration, blur, and noise. 

This UMIE dataset is used only for academic purposes. The re-distribution of this dataset is forbidden. Here is the one and only download port. The infringement will be held responsible.
